Hey there! I'm Erika Heidi, a developer / devOps turned writer. I enjoy writing tutorials and guides about all sorts of things.

In this blog you will find content about software development (typically PHP), systems administration, devOps, and also comics and illustrations that I like to create in my free time.

Don't forget to check out the [live streams](/live) section, where you can find recent live recordings of my streams.
